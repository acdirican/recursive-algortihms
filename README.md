# Recursive Algorithms
This projects provides java implementations of popular recursive algorithms .

Iterative algorithms are like eating a bread by slicing. You know the number of slice and eat a slice at every iteration.

Recursive algorithms, on the other hand, are like eating a bread by snatching pieces from it until there is nothing left.
